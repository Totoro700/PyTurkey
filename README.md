This repository (PyTurkey) is for Thanksgiving, on thursday, November 26


Find the file named "PyTurkey.py", open it, and run the code or click [here](https://github.com/Totoro700/PyTurkey/blob/main/PyTurkey.py) to directly open it


Once you run it, you can type [commands](https://github.com/Totoro700/PyTurkey/commands.txt) and play a small game to get turkey! Don't sell them though!
